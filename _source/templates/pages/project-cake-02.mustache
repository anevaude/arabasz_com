				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>After the successful launch of Cake’s <a href="https://www.joincake.com/online-memorial-pages/" target="_blank">Memorial page creation service</a>, we wanted to tackle one of the biggest challenges of planning a funeral -- paying for it.</p>

				<p>Typically when it came to raising money, people would rely on services like GoFundMe. However, we felt this created a disjointed experience for our users and decided to explore adding a fundraising tool directly to the memorial creation page.</p>

				
				<h3>Team & Role</h3>
				<p>I served as a <strong>UX Designer</strong>, <strong>Front End Developer</strong> and <strong>Scrum Master</strong>, with my primary responsibilities including  quantitative research, competitor analysis, and designing the wireframes and user flow.</p>
				<p>I collaborated closely with two Back End Developers and one Front End Developer to make the design a reality.</p>
				
				<p>(Awesome note: Because I had coding alongside this team for years, I was often able to describe quick changes to the team with no need to do redo the design!)</p>

				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide memorial creators with an in-app solution for fundraising</li>
					<li>Give memorial creators a way to tell a story about how funds will help</li>
					<li>Make it easy for memorial creators to track how much they have left to go in their fundraising goal</li>
  					<li>Allow memorial visitors to donate funds securely</li>			
  				</ul>

				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Establishing trust with memorial creators. Assure users that Cake is a legitimate and respected source for fundraising./li>
					<li>Securely collecting and tracking funds</li>	
  				</ul>

				<h3>Target audience</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Individuals creating a memorial page, usually a friend or family member of the deceased.</li>
					<li>Varying levels of tech-savviness, generally comfortable with making profiles on Facebook.</li>	
					<li>All age groups, although Cake users were predominantly within the 35-50 years old range.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />


<h3>Process</h3>

<h4>User flow</h4>
<p>In crafting the user flow, my main focus was on making things easy and brief, especially considering the emotional weight of planning a funeral. I wanted to reduce the potential frustration of going to different parts of the site to accomplish related things.
</p>
<p>To achieve this, I centered my flow around a single branching question, asking users if they were interested in a fundraiser. If they said no, they wouldn't be bothered with more fundraiser-related questions at that stage. No prodding.
</p>
<p>I also wanted to make sure the user could feel like they could take a break -- adding several points points where they could say no or go back, without feeling pressured to finish the form in one go. This approach was aimed at providing flexibility and understanding for users, especially during a challenging time of loss.

<h4>Wireframe</h4>
<p>When working on the wireframes, I wanted to create an experience that felt simple but safe. Fatigue is always something you should keep in mind with UX, and grieving users are especially sensitive to being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I made it a point to keep each group of questions short, around 4-6 at most per screen. This way, it's easy to go through, and I could organize questions based on common themes. Keeping things simple also meant less scrolling, especially for those using mobile devices.
</p>
<p>I also recommended adding a Preview option at the end. This feature assures users that they can take a break and come back to finish later. Users had enough on their plate.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>The project delivered a comprehensive user flow and wireframes, serving as the blueprint for the web application's development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React).</p>

<p>I created the design deliverables, and I coded alongside my developer team to create the feature. As we coded, I would go back to the design and make changes if we saw something we could improve along the way. </p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Just a week after launching the fundraising tool, we were thrilled to see our first users successfully adding fundraisers to their memorial pages.</p>
<p>Requests to our Customer Support dropped by 40-50%, allowing our team to help with more urgent matters.</p>
<p>After collecting a few weeks of data, I noticed a pattern of users not fully completing the flow. There was a bottleneck at the login/registration touchpoint, where only 28-30% of users getting to the next step.</p>

<p>After verifying that no bugs or technical issues were going on, we recognized that more data was needed to figure out why users were getting stuck. I will be sharing details of that project in a future post.</p>
