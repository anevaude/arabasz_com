				<p>A collection of sites summarizing the <em>X Games</em> and <em>ESPYs Awards</em>. The primary audience is event sponsors, who use the website to see how their brand was promoted.</p>
				<p>Each site contains a large collection of media files from the event, including photos, videos and PDFs. Sponsors can log in to a password-protected area to view marketing statistic documents.</p>
				<p>The original version of the site was built in 2012 on the Expression Engine CMS. It was revamped in 2015 using Mustache and Foundation, resulting in a much simpler and easier-to-maintain experience.</p>
