				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm a <strong>UX Designer/Developer</strong> in Boston with 15+ years of experience. With a background in graphic design, I enjoy bridging the gap between creative teams and engineering.</p> 

				<p>I'm passionate about tech inclusion and started the Boston chapter of <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a>, a national non-profit offering affordable coding classes for women.</p>

				<p>Beyond the pixels, you'll find me navigating the fiery world of hot sauces, indulging in craft beers or hiking with my Corgi <a href="http://instagram.com/starbuck_the_corgi" target="_blank">Starbuck</a>.</p>
