				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>In 2016, many websites were optimized for desktop-only. It was not uncommon for users to visit a site on their phone to see either a broken experience or a "Please visit us on desktop" message.</p>

				<p>Bank of America knew it had to modernize, but it needed someone to prove that their complex banking tools could be translated to a mobile viewport.</p>
							
				<h3>Team & Role</h3>
				<p>I was the Creative Technologist on this project, coding the component library. I worked closely with the design team to ensure that anything we designed was feasible on mobile, reassessing the design as issues arose.</p>

				<p>The project involved two developers, one UX researcher, one UX designer, one visual designer and one client experience director.</p>

				<h3>Process</h3>
				<p>The design and developer teams worked together to sketch out how each element on the page can be broken down into a mobile equivalent. As we coded, we would often regroup and make adjustments to the design as we encounted blockers. </p>

				<p>The design system was coded with HTML5, CSS, and some jQuery for interactions like carousels and tabs. Feature detection and CSS fallbacks were addressed with Modernizer (<a href="https://modernizr.com/">https://modernizr.com</a>). 
				<br />

				<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>The deliverable was a responsive design system and six prototypes showing how some of Bank of America's most popular pages can be adapted from a desktop layout into a mobile-friendly version.</p>

				<p>The Bank of America team was excited to see that even the most complex elements of their page, like navigation and tables, <em>can</em> be built for a mobile screen.</p>

				<p>I'm excited about this project because it served as a baseline for BoA's eventual conversion to full mobile-friendliness. Today, Bank of America's banking website is completely mobile-friendly, and I am proud to know that we helped play an essential part in that.</p>
