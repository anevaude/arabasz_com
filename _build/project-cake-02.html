				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>After the successful launch of Cake's <a href="https://www.joincake.com/online-memorial-pages/" target="_blank">Memorial Page Maker</a>, the next challenge was tackling one of the most significant pains of Cake users -- paying for it.</p>

				<p>Typically, when raising money for funerals, people rely on services like GoFundMe. However, making the user leave the site created a disjointed experience and risked them never returning.</p>
				
				<h3>Team & Role</h3>
				<p>I served as a <strong>UX Designer</strong> and <strong>Front-end Developer</strong>. The team included two Back-end Developers, one Front-end Developer and a Project Manager. My main tasks included:</p>
				
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>sketching</li>
						<li>wireframing</li>
						<li>user flows</li>
						<li>qualitative research (exit surveys, screen recordings, heat maps)</li>
						<li>quantitative research (conversion data, clickthrough rate)</li>
						<li>competitor analysis</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>(Awesome note: Because I had coding alongside this team for years, I was often able to convey quick changes with no need to redo the design!)</p>

				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide memorial creators with an in-app solution for fundraising</li>
					<li>Give memorial creators a way to share their fundraising story</li>
  					<li>Allow memorial visitors to transfer funds from their bank account or credit card securely</li>			
  				</ul>

				<h3>Target audience</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Memorial Creator:</strong> The person who created the memorial page, usually a friend or family member of the deceased.</li>
					<li>Users were predominantly within the 30-49 year old range.</li>
					<li>Users had varying levels of tech-savviness but were generally familiar with making profiles on social media sites like Facebook.</li>	
				</ul>
				<br />


				<h3>Process</h3>

				<h4>Sketching</h4>
				<p>I started by getting my initial thoughts and observations down on paper. I find it helpful to start a project by letting all my thoughts out so I can figure out what to focus on first.</p>

				<h4>User flow</h4>
				<p>In crafting the user flow, my main focus was making things easy and brief, especially considering the emotional weight of planning a funeral. I wanted to reduce the potential frustration of going to different parts of the site to accomplish related things.
				</p>
				<p>To achieve this, I centered my flow around a single branching question, asking users if they were interested in a fundraiser. If they said no, they wouldn't be bothered with more fundraiser-related questions at that stage. No prodding.
				</p>

<h4>Wireframe (Low Fidelity)</h4>
<p>When working on the design, I kept in mind the feelings and emotions that users most often reported as they pertained to funeral planning:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fatigue.</strong> People planning a funeral are often tired and may require more breaks to complete a process, sometimes stepping away completely.</li>
	<li><strong>Confusion.</strong> Most people planning a funeral are learning everything for the first time and can feel confused when presented with unfamiliar terms. (e.g., "columbarium", "direct burial")</li>
	<li><strong>Distrust/wariness.</strong> Unfortunately, many people have experienced identity theft when using Internet services and approach unfamiliar apps with increased caution.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I wanted to create an experience that felt simple but safe. Because grieving users are especially susceptible to becoming overwhelmed, it was important to guide them at their pace and comfort level.</p>

<p>I grouped questions in small clusters, with a max of 3-5 fields per screen. This way, the flow allows for pauses, and I could organize questions based on common themes.</p>
<p>Keeping things simple also meant less scrolling, especially for those using mobile devices -- lessening users' cognitive load and risk of abandonment.
</p>

<p>I also recommended adding a Preview option at the end. This feature assures users they can take a break and return to finish later. Users had enough on their plate.
</p>

<h4>Wireframe (High Fidelity)</h4>
<p>After iterating through a few different wireframe designs, I created a high-fidelity wireframe that outlined styling direction.</p>
<p>As a developer, I also thought it would be helpful to add notes about form field behavior, error validation and what API responses to expect.</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>The project took about two months between design and implementation, followed by further testing.</p>
<p>After I delivered the user flow and wireframes, I worked with the dev team to implement the tool. The code stack was HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React), with Stripe as the secure payments handler.</p>

<h3>Results</h3> 
<p>Just a week after launching the fundraising tool, we were thrilled to see our first users successfully adding fundraisers to their memorial pages. Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Initial feedback from users was positive</li>
	<li>Fewer requests to customer support for help</li>
	<li>Fewer linkbacks to GoFundMe and external tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the initial launch was promising, more time was needed to understand long-term performance. Further iterations would focus on:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Trust:</strong> Users wanted more reassurance about <em>how</em> we were making money. The funeral industry is riddled with predatory practices.</li>
	<li><strong>Tone:</strong> When it comes to talking about funerals and death, every person's comfort level is unique. </li>
</ul>
