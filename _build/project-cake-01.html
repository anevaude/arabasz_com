				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>As the company's first Front End Developer, I had the exciting opportunity to do a top-to-bottom evaluation of the app and recommend improvements to usability, mobile-friendliness and overall look and feel.</p>
				<p>For my role, I was involved in both design and development. The design was created on-the-fly by working closely with the Product Owner. The code team was me (HTML, CSS and JS for interactions) and two Back End Devs (C#, JS for fetching of data).</p>
				<br />
				
				<h3>Universal improvements</h3>
				<p>Because trust and security is a top priority for users, it was important for the site to feel cohesive and... like Cake. I made my first goal making the app look more polished with clear and reflective of the Cake brand.</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Resolved failing contrast:</strong> There was insufficient contrast between the sidenav and background colors, which could cause accessibility issues and impact Google Lighthouse scores. I updated the nav to ones that would pass contrast tests, while maintaining the company branding.
					<li><strong>Added logo to nav: </strong>  By adding the logo in and incorporating more of brand's colors (light teal, dark deal and cream), the website began to feel less like a prototype and more like an official product.</li>
					<li><strong>Icon changes:</strong> The box icons looked like checkboxes, which could be confusing to users. Users also didn't understand what the categories meant, so we removed them entirely from the nav.</li>
					<li><strong>Simplified IA:</strong> As a developer, it ws clear to me that the nav had grown over the years to accommodate a rapidly-changing number of tools. I proposed a new sitemap that addressed links that were redundant or ambiguous, merging the bulk of the "Discover" child links into a single parent named "Checklist".</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Mobile-friendliness</h3>
				<p>The app was originally designed with desktop users in mind. While this allowed Cake to fit several tools into a wide area, I had a feeling we were leaving out a significant mobile audience. Furthermore, mobile users who <em>were</em> using the app on their phone were met with a subpar experience, frequently encountering too-small touch targets or "broken" elements due to lack of CSS fallbacks. </p>
				<p>To confirm my hypothesis, I used Google Analytics to confirm that 64-68% of users who visited the Cake homepage from a mobile or tablet device. Furthermore, that number was increasing by 1-2% every year. This data confirmed for me the urgency of making the app more mobile-friendly in order to better serve its audience and stay competitive.</p>
				

				<h3>Discover page improvements</h3>
				<p>Every user started with the "Discover" tool. The tool was meant to look like a deck of cards that users can flip through to answer important questions about their healthcare and funeral/burial preferences. They could select their answer on each card or skip any they weren't comfortable answering. Changes added:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Making the "cards" more card-like:</strong> The "Discover" tool was intended to look like a deck of cards that the user can flip through, so I redesigned it with elements common in a playing card like rounded corners.</li>
					<li><strong>Swipe gestures:</strong> Previously, only the "Back" and "Save" buttons could be used to swipe. I added touch-activated arrows to allow swiping on mobile/tablet. </li>
					<li><strong>Large answer fields:</strong> To make the answers easier to click on mobile, I increased the size of the buttons and added iconography to indicate yes/no answers.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Document page improvements</h3>
				<p>Documents was the page where users can upload important files like their Wills or Health Care Proxy forms. The original design had pre-named slots where users can upload the named document and add notes about it. (e.g. If you wanted to upload your Will, you'd have to upload it to the Will box.) One of my concerns was that this design assumed the user (a) had all of the documents ready (b) knew what each document was and (c) had no need to upload any documents other than the ones we provided slots for. </p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Loosened the scope for document upload:</strong> Instead of uploading documents into slots, I recommended that we allow a user to upload any document they felt was important and then apply a category (Type) as they saw fit. This was especially helpful in cases where a user needed to upload a file that didn't fit our slots.</li>
					<li><strong>Changed layout</strong> When it comes to file lists, a pattern that has been used consistently for years has been the Dropbox or Google Drive file list. I suggested this pattern as a way to display files that is not only cleaner, but familiar and intuititve. Additionally, it cut down on the amount of room needed to display files. The original design took up a lot of vertical height, which could lead to a frustrating experience as users scrolled endlessly to find their file.</li>

				</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Migrating to a Mobile-first Framework</h3>
				<p>Although Bootstrap v3 had been an adequate framework for building the initial prototype of the app, it was no longer adequate for supporting a mobile-first experience. Together with the back end developer on my team, we outlined the following requirements:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Cost:</b> Free or cheap. As a startup, we could not afford an expensive solution</li>
					<li><b>Easy:</b> Back End developers would have to be comfortable with it</li>
					<li><b>Mobile-first:</b> We couldn't leave mobile users hanging</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Additionally, due to the nature of being a pre-seed startup at the time and thus sensitive to fund raising cycles, we could not afford to delay new features  or cause site downtime. Based on these discussions, I proposed the following options:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Option 1:</b> Upgrade Bootstrap from 3 to 4, requiring a rebuild of 90% of the app</li>
					<li><b>Option 2:</b> Drop Bootstrap and replace with a mobile-first framework like Foundation</li>
					<li><b>Option 3:</b> Build our own responsive framework with grid system</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>We decided that Option 1 (upgrading Bootstrap) would be the least disruptive and require the least learning curve to ramp back up. It took about 1-2 months to fully upgrade, with gradual fixes popping up over the months that followed.</p>
				-->

				<h3>!! More Details Coming Soon</h3>
				<p>Gradually adding more as I get approval to post additional screenshots. As always, you can email me to ask about specific examples. (updated 12/6/2023)</p>
