				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>As an early-stage startup with a tiny team, the app had quickly evolved from a scrappy prototype to a tool that was being used by hundreds of users. We needed to move quickly to make the app look more polished and trustworthy.</p>
				
				<p>As the company's first Frontend Developer, I had the exciting opportunity to review our app and suggest improvements for usability, mobile-friendliness, and overall appearance.</p>

				<h3>Team & Role</h3>

				<p>I served as both a <strong>Front End Developer</strong> and <strong>Designer</strong>, working closely with the team to make decisions and deploy them straight-to-code.</p>
				<p>In addition to myself, the team included two Back End Developers and a Product Owner.
				<br />
				
				<h3>Global improvements</h3>
				<p>Trust and safety were a top need for Cake users, who often uploaded sensitive documents and shared highly personal details about their end-of-life wishes. I felt it was important for the site to feel authentic and trustworthy. My first goal was to make the site look polished, cohesive and reflective of the company brand. Some highlights:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Brand Integration: </strong> Added the company logo to the navigation and used the brand's colors (light teal, dark teal, and cream) to make the website look more official and less like a prototype.</li>
					<li><strong>Icon Tweaks:</strong> Updated box-like icons that resembled checkboxes, which could confuse users. Also, removed ambiguous category icons from the navigation.</li>
					<li><strong>Simplified IA:</strong> As a developer, it was clear to me that the nav had grown over the years to accommodate a rapidly changing number of tools. I proposed a new sitemap that addressed links that were redundant or ambiguous, merging the bulk of the "Discover" child links into a single parent named "Checklist".</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<br />
				
				<h3>Improvements to the Discover page</h3>
				<p>Every new user started off with the "Discover" tool, so it was important that we get this part right. The tool was designed as a virtual deck of cards that a user can flip through and answer crucial questions about their healthcare and funeral/burial preferences. Key changes included:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Card-like Aesthetics:</strong> Redesigned the "Discover" tool to emulate a deck of cards, incorporating rounded corners and themed borders to enhance the visual resemblance to a playing card.</li>
					<li><strong>Swipe Functionality:</strong> Expanded user interaction by introducing swipe gestures. In addition to the existing "Back" and "Save" buttons, touch-activated arrows were integrated, allowing seamless swiping on mobile and tablet devices.</li>
					<li><strong>Touch-friendly fields:</strong> Improved mobile usability by enlarging answer buttons, meeting minimum recommended sizing for touch points. Iconography was also introduced to clearly indicate yes/no answers.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<br />
				<br />
				
				<h3>Improvements to the Documents page</h3>
				<p>The Documents page served as the platform for users to upload vital files such as Wills or Health Care Proxy forms. A notable concern was the rigid design that assigned specific slots for document uploads (e.g., Wills could only be uploaded to the "Wills" box). This assumed users (a) had all documents ready, (b) knew each document's purpose, and (c) had no need for uploading documents beyond the provided slots. To address these limitations, I proposed the following changes:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Flexible Document Upload:</strong> Instead of confining users to pre-assigned slots, I recommended a more versatile approach. Users could now upload any document they deemed important and subsequently categorize it (i.e. Type) according to their preferences. This proved especially beneficial for cases where users needed to upload files that didn't match our predefined slots.</li>
					<li><strong>Revamped layout</strong> A shift from the original design involved adopting a file list pattern akin to Dropbox or Google Drive, a format consistently recognized and used for years. This not only presented a cleaner and more familiar display of files but also proved to be more intuitive. Additionally, this modification significantly reduced the vertical space required to showcase files, preventing a potentially frustrating user experience of endless scrolling.</li>

				</ul>
				</p>


<!-- 

				<h3>Migrating to a Mobile-first Framework</h3>
				<p>Although Bootstrap v3 had been an adequate framework for building the initial prototype of the app, it was no longer adequate for supporting a mobile-first experience. Together with the back end developer on my team, we outlined the following requirements:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Cost:</b> Free or cheap. As a startup, we could not afford an expensive solution</li>
					<li><b>Easy:</b> Back End developers would have to be comfortable with it</li>
					<li><b>Mobile-first:</b> We couldn't leave mobile users hanging</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Additionally, due to the nature of being a pre-seed startup at the time and thus sensitive to fund raising cycles, we could not afford to delay new features  or cause site downtime. Based on these discussions, I proposed the following options:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Option 1:</b> Upgrade Bootstrap from 3 to 4, requiring a rebuild of 90% of the app</li>
					<li><b>Option 2:</b> Drop Bootstrap and replace with a mobile-first framework like Foundation</li>
					<li><b>Option 3:</b> Build our own responsive framework with grid system</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>We decided that Option 1 (upgrading Bootstrap) would be the least disruptive and require the least learning curve to ramp back up. It took about 1-2 months to fully upgrade, with gradual fixes popping up over the months that followed.</p>
				-->

				
				<h3>Mobile Optimization</h3>
				<p>The app was originally designed with desktop users in mind, but it was 2018 and I had a feeling we were leaving out a significant mobile audience.</p>
				<p>I used Google Analytics to confirm that 64-68% of users who visited the Cake homepage from a mobile or tablet device. This data underscored the pressing need to prioritize mobile-friendliness to better serve the app's audience and stay competitive.</p>
				
				<!--
				<h3>Accessibility</h3>
				<p>When I do accessibility evaluations, my focus revolves around ensuring compliance with core Section 508 and WCAG guidelines. Frequently, websites overlook simple adjustments that can significantly improve the experience for individuals with impairments. Some of the updates I added:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Keyboard and tab index:</strong> Ensured comprehensive keyboard accessibility, confirming that all elements could be accessed without reliance on a mouse. (Sometimes I unplugged my mouse to be extra sure!)</li>
						<li><strong>ARIA and alt tags:</strong> Incorporated ARIA tags and alt tags wherever applicable. This approach aimed to eliminate any ambiguity and enhance the experience for individuals relying on assistive technologies.</li>
						<li><strong>Resolved failing contrast:</strong> Addressed an insufficient contrast issue between the side nav and background colors, which could pose accessibility challenges and impact Google Lighthouse scores. The navigation was updated to ensure it passed contrast tests while still maintaining alignment with the company's branding.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
